## Introduction

OpenAI has revolutionized the way we interact and think about AI today. The ChatGPT democratized AI like anything happened before. People who studied Machine Learning, Statistics and Mathematics have been talking about it and working on finding new ways. Most of them were stuck in theory. Thus, making it inaccessible to most of us till ChatGPT swapped it away. 

What ChatGPT did was build an easy interface for us to play with it. API played a key critical role, allowing developers to think about designing domain specific GenAI applications. People realized GPT model works best with certain limitations. It canâ€™t be used with private data as-is. However, the RAG pattern revolutionized the OpenAI and its real use case.   

Amidst the flood of so-called AI enthusiasts, it is the developers who are still trying to find the holy grail of development. Talking to developers, one thing is clear that they have the skillset to call an API but to design the end of end application which can be used by end users is not yet clear.

In this series it is a humble effort to deal with the basic flow of building a GenAI-based web application which can be packaged and deployed as cloud native way.

## Instructions

### Config file
You need an `.env` file with the following values 

```bash
OPENAI_API_VERSION = "2024-07-01-preview"

AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY = "{key}"
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = "{endpoint url}"

AZURE_OPENAI_COMPLETION_MODEL = "gpt-35-turbo"
AZURE_OPENAI_COMPLETION_DEPLOYMENT_NAME = "gpt-35-turbo-dev"
```

The file should be put in the folder from where we will run the code. If it is placed in different location please give the specific path. 

> If you are changing any value while the jupyter notebook is loaded, you need to **restart** the kernel to reflect the changes. 

### Dependencies

You may run this command to install all the libraries

```python
pip install python-dotenv streamlit langchain langchain-openai openai==1.46.0
```

### Container image Build

You need docker engine running in your dev machine. 

```
docker build -t customerweb:v1 .
```

To run it locally, run the below command. This will open a browser locally. 

```
docker run -p 8501:8501 customerweb:v1
```

### Container image push

Login to the container registry using below command. It will ask you to enter the user name and password. 

```
docker login container-registry-url
```

Once it is logged in, rename (`tag`) the local container image based on the registry you chose. Then 

```
docker push container-registry-url/customer:v1 
```

> **Note:** You should supply the secrets via standard secret management process. Avoid using `.env` file in production.
